## About

The Chinese Heritage Church (CHC) Collaborative is just that: a collaboration among ministers from Chinese heritage churches. A group of English speaking pastors gathered in Boston in May 2019 to connect and see if they might find value in further developing relationships. After that 2019 Pastors Colloquium, those pastors decided they would be willing to meet again and see where God leads. A second Pastors Colloquium was scheduled for 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic happened and plans were altered. But after two online Colloquiums, the pastors agreed to name an Executive Team and commissioned two foundational papers to be written. Producing those two papers would provide the opportunity for this group to clarify our thinking and to invite others to dialogue about what we were doing. [One paper](/what) is about the history and thinking behind the term "Chinese heritage church." [Another paper](/apologetic) served as an opportunity to make a positive case for how God is using ethnic heritage churches like the Chinese heritage church. You can find those papers on this website.

After the papers were written and received approval from the pastors, the group commissioned the Executive Team to work on our first public gathering. That first public gathering would become known as our first Ministers Collective.

The initial group of pastors was invited by a small steering team of pastors. We simply looked around the English speaking world and invited friends and colleagues we had met along the way from the USA, Canada, and Europe.

For now, those on the Executive Team sense there may be significant value to encourage and offer ways for ministers in Chinese heritage churches to connect. Perhaps this little adventure will conclude after our first public event. Or, perhaps the Lord would lead us to continue in various initiatives. Only the Lord knows!

## What We Believe

Because we’re committed to serving Chinese heritage churches across various denominations and theological traditions, we approach collaboration from a center-bounded mindset. That means we can accept differences in belief and practice so long as we are centered on the orthodox truths of the Christian faith and a shared vision for the Chinese heritage church. 

Our understanding of Christian orthodoxy can be summarized in ancient creeds like the Apostles’ and Nicene or in modern formulations like Christiany Today’s Statement of Faith (see below). And our shared vision for the mission of the Chinese heritage church is captured in our organization’s [Foundational Papers](#foundational-papers). 

Anyone who can readily affirm the following Statement of Faith and our Foundational Papers can benefit from the relationships and resources provided by this Collaborative. 


**Statement of Faith (Christianity Today)**

1. The sixty-six canonical books of the Bible as originally written were inspired of God, hence free from error. They constitute the only infallible guide in faith and practice.
2. There is one God, the Creator and Preserver of all things, infinite in being and perfection. He exists eternally in three Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, who are of one substance and equal in power and glory.
3. God created Adam and Eve in his own image. By disobedience, they fell from their sinless state through the temptation by Satan. This fall plunged humanity into a state of sin and spiritual death, and brought upon the entire race the sentence of eternal death. From this condition we can be saved only by the grace of God, through faith, on the basis of the work of Christ, and by the agency of the Holy Spirit.
4. The eternally pre-existent Son became incarnate without human father, by being born of the Virgin Mary. Thus, in the Lord Jesus Christ, divine and human natures were united in one Person, both natures being whole, perfect, and distinct. To effect salvation, he lived a sinless life and died on the cross as the sinner's substitute, shedding his blood for the remission of sins. On the third day he rose from the dead in the body which had been laid in the tomb. He ascended to the right hand of the Father, where he performs the ministry of intercession. He shall come again, personally and visibly, to complete his saving work and to consummate the eternal plan of God.
5. The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Triune God. He applies to man the work of Christ. By justification and adoption we are given a right standing before God; by regeneration, sanctification, and glorification our nature is renewed.
6. When we have turned to God in penitent faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, we are accountable to God for living a life separated from sin and characterized by the fruit of the Spirit. It is our responsibility to contribute by word and deed to the universal spread of the Gospel.
7. At the end of the age, the bodies of the dead shall be raised. The righteous shall enter into full possession of eternal bliss in the presence of God, and the wicked shall be condemned to eternal death.
